# typographic_clock

This is a 'word' clock that I spent a Saturday figuring out how to make after my NASA mentors said "Fix the atrocious broken data visualization dashboard that's written in JavaScript" and I had never worked with JavaScript before.

It's just a pretty thing. Because a clock that says 8:45 is too mainstream, I wanted to make something that said "It's a quarter till eight on Friday, February 7". I didn't actually even end up using it on the dashboard because it's *that* pointless. I built it because I remembered having something like this on a Dreamboard theme on my jailbroken iPod in high school and thought it was cool.
